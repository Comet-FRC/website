## Tyler STEAM Night: A Roaring Success, Back for Year Three!

**Comet Robotics** was thrilled to host the **Tyler STEAM Night** for the second consecutive year at **Tyler Elementary School in Haymarket, VA**. This highly anticipated event once again brought the exciting world of **robotics and engineering** to young, eager minds through a variety of engaging, hands-on activities.

### Inspiring the Next Generation

With approximately **150 attendees**, our STEAM Night was a huge hit! It was incredible to see so many students inspired and actively participating, exploring fundamental STEAM concepts in a fun and interactive environment. From building simple machines to controlling robots, the night was packed with moments of discovery and excitement.

### A Collaborative Effort

This successful event was made possible through the invaluable collaboration with our partners: **BAAP, the Science National Honor Society, the Math Honor Society, and the STAR Club**. Their support and dedication were crucial in creating such a memorable and impactful experience for the Tyler Elementary community.

We're already looking forward to making the third annual Tyler STEAM Night even more spectacular next year!
