## Gravely STEAM Night: Back for Our Third Year!

We're thrilled to announce our return to **Gravely STEAM Night** for the third year in a row! This annual event is a fantastic opportunity to engage with the community and ignite a passion for **STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics)** in young minds.

### A Robotics Hit in 2024!

Last year marked a special milestone as we introduced our **Crescendo robot** to the STEAM Night for the very first time. It was an absolute sensation with the elementary schoolers! The robot's ability to **shoot out notes** captivated everyone, making robotics an engaging and accessible concept. It was incredibly rewarding to see the children's excitement and curiosity as they interacted with our creation.

### Fostering Creativity and Learning

Gravely STEAM Night is more than just fun; it's a platform to **showcase our team's creativity** and **introduce younger students to core STEAM concepts** in an interactive and memorable way. We believe that hands-on experiences like these are crucial for sparking early interest in these vital fields.

### Continuing the Tradition

We are excited to continue this tradition and are already planning to make this year's event even better! We look forward to another successful night of inspiring the next generation of innovators and problem-solvers.

Stay tuned for more details about what we'll be bringing to Gravely STEAM Night 2025!
