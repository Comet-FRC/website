## Alvey STEAM Night: Inspiring Innovation, Year After Year

**Comet Robotics** was proud to participate in the **Alvey STEAM Night** for the second year in a row, and we're looking forward to returning again! This event is a fantastic example of community collaboration, bringing together several local clubs to create an engaging and interactive experience for students, all while showcasing the exciting world of **robotics and STEAM**.

### Hands-On Exploration and Creativity

The night was packed with dynamic, **hands-on activities** designed to spark curiosity and foster learning. Students had a blast **building with Snap Circuits**, getting a chance to **drive our robot**, and unleashing their creativity at the **personalized pin-making station**. Each activity provided a unique opportunity for young minds to explore fundamental science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics concepts.
